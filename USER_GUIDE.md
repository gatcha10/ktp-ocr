## Getting Started

The KTP Scanner is a web application that works on both desktop and mobile browsers. To get started:

1. Open the application URL in your web browser
2. Ensure you have a clear image of a KTP ready for upload
3. The application works best with well-lit, clearly visible KTP images

## Uploading a KTP Image

There are two ways to upload a KTP image:

### Method 1: Click and Select

1. Click the "Pilih File" button in the center of the upload area
2. Browse your device and select a JPG image of a KTP
3. The selected image will appear in the preview area

### Method 2: Drag and Drop

1. Drag a JPG image file from your computer
2. Drop it onto the upload area (the dashed rectangle)
3. The image will automatically appear in the preview area

**Note:** Only JPG/JPEG images up to 5MB in size are supported.

If you need to change the image, click the "âœ•" button on the preview to remove it and upload a different one.

## Extracting Data

Once you've uploaded a KTP image:

1. Click the "Ekstrak Data" button below the image preview
2. Wait while the system processes the image (this may take a few seconds)
3. The extracted data will appear in a form below the image

During extraction, you'll see a loading indicator. If the extraction takes too long (more than 30 seconds), try refreshing the page and uploading a clearer image.

## Reviewing and Editing Data

After extraction, you should:

1. Review all extracted data fields for accuracy
2. Edit any fields that were incorrectly extracted or missing
3. Pay special attention to the NIK (ID number) field, as it's required

The form includes various field types:
- Text fields for information like name and NIK
- Dropdown selectors for gender, religion, etc.
- Text areas for longer content like addresses

Required fields are marked with a red asterisk (*) and must be filled before submission.

## Submitting Data

Once you've reviewed and corrected the data:

1. Click the "Simpan Data" button at the bottom of the form
2. Wait for the confirmation message that data was saved successfully
3. The form will reset after successful submission

If there are validation errors, they will be displayed, and you'll need to correct them before resubmitting.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "Hanya file JPG yang diperbolehkan!" | Make sure you're uploading a JPG/JPEG image |
| "Ukuran file maksimal 5MB!" | Reduce the image size to under 5MB |
| "Gagal mengekstrak data" | Try uploading a clearer image with better lighting |
| "NIK harus 16 digit angka" | Ensure the NIK field contains exactly 16 digits |
| Form won't submit | Check for validation errors in required fields |

### Tips for Better Results

1. Use a well-lit, high-contrast image of the KTP
2. Ensure the KTP is fully visible in the frame
3. Avoid glare or shadows on the KTP
4. Place the KTP against a dark background for better contrast
5. Make sure the KTP text is clearly legible
